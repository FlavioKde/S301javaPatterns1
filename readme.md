📚 Exercise Summary
🔸 Level 1 – Singleton
Undo Manager
Replicates the functionality of a Linux-style Undo/History command. The Undo class is a Singleton that stores and manages commands entered via the console.

🔸 Level 2 – Abstract Factory
International Address Book
Implements an address book that allows for creating addresses and phone numbers in international formats using the Abstract Factory pattern.

🔸 Level 3 – Command
Vehicle Simulator
Designs a parking lot of 4 vehicles: a car, bike, plane, and boat. Demonstrates the use of the Command pattern to start, accelerate, and brake for each vehicle type.

Happy Coding! 🚀
